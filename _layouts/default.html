   <p id= "first"><li>Tsunamis have many ways of forming, they also vary in size depending on the severity of the force that caused them.</li>  
     <li>They can be tall as a building, or shorter than a house.</li>  
     <li>The question is though, can a tsunami really reach the peak of a Himalayan Mountain?</li>
     <li>Well if the conditions are right, then yes, a tsunami might actually reach the top of some of the world’s largest mountains.</li> 
     <li>A tsunami can be caused by a variety of different forces. </li>
     <li>This includes, the most well known, an earthquake.</li></p>

  <p id="second">An earthquake of high enough severity could cause an enormous tsunami capable of reaching the Himalayas.  In some places tsunamis have been known to surge vertically as high as 100 feet(nationalgeographic.com).  This means that a regular earthquake is nowhere near enough to reach the Himalayan Mountains on its own.  However, with some help, it might be able to.  As talked about in Geology.com, there was an earthquake on July 9, 1958 that singlehandedly caused 40 million cubic yards of rock to fall from the northeastern shore of Lituya Bay.  The rocks fell from an altitude of 3000 feet.  When they hit the ocean, the waves went as high as 1,720 feet destroying everything in sight.  That tsunami was the largest one recorded in history.  Still it is 20,058 feet short of reaching the smallest of the himalayan mountains.  That mountain being Mount Kailash which stands at 21,778 feet.  So can there really be a tsunami that can at least reach as high as Mount Kailash?  Well, earthquakes aren’t the only cause for tsunamis; there are also meteorite strikes.</p>

  <p id="third">Meteorite strikes can also cause tsunamis of high caliber.  “A tsunami is a series of waves generated in an ocean or other body of water by a disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite impact”(windows2universe.org).  This quote states that a meteorite strike, could form a tsunami, meaning that, if a big enough meteorite lands near the Himalayas with enough force, a tsunami wave capable of reaching the Himalayan Mountains could form.  The size and force of the impact are what really matter, and are what will decide if the tsunami will be enough to reach the Himalayas.</p>
    <h1>Other</h1>
  <p id="last">In conclusion, a tsunami of great enough strength to reach the Himalayan Mountain could form if the conditions are met.  A regular earthquake or weak force isn’t enough to cause such an enormous tsunami.  However, with some help, it could actually make it.  It isn’t likely to happen anytime soon, but it definitely is possible if every factor needed is there.  All in all, can a tsunami make it all the way to the Himalayan Mountains?  Yes, yes it can.</p>
